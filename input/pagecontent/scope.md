### Functional Scope
This Implementation Guide focuses on the exchange of scheduled medication administrations.  


The scheduled medication administrations is simply a detailed list of the medications to be taken at a given time.  
For example, if a medication prescription is for taking the drug 2 times a day for 7 days, this corresponds to 14 scheduled medication administrations.  

The scheduled medication administrations can be used in personalized care, for example a medication mobile app for patients, or apps/portals for nurses for home care.
